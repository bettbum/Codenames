Codenames Rules

INTRODUCTION
Codenames is a game for two teams. There is a grid of 25 words. Some of them are secretly assigned to the Red Team, some to the Blue Team. One player from each team is the Spymaster, and only Spymasters see which words belong to which team. Spymasters take turns giving clues to their teammates (Operatives), trying to lead them to guessing their team's words. The team that guesses all their words first wins the game.

DIVING IN TEAMS
Divide all players into two teams, red and blue.
One player from each team should click on the red or blue button that says “Spymaster.” He or she will then see the colors of the cards.
Everyone else should click on the red or blue button that says “Operative.” They do not see the colors of the cards.

GIVING CLUES
Spymasters give clues. When it’s your turn to give a clue, tap some words in your color that you want to give a clue for. Then type in a one-word clue that relates to all the selected words. Your Operatives will only see the clue and the number of marked cards.
When you give a clue, your Operatives only see the word and the number.
Watch out for the black card, it’s an Assassin! Avoid clues that would lead to the assassin or to the other team's words.
